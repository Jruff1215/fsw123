            Bounty Hunters are "early adopters" for the most advanced weapons technologies. They have both the credits and the opportunities 
            to experiment with all manner of gadgets. Though almost always handy with blasters, Bounty Hunters also keep tricks up their sleeve 
            such as a wrist mounted missile launcher.

             No matter how much planning and strategy is done before an assault, 
            close-quarters combat is often unavoidable. Fortunately, Bounty Hunters are equipped with the gear to burn anyone or anything that 
            decides to get too close.
